on the Parasympathetic side, the image indicates that for the Preganglionic neuron the soma is usually in the brainstem or sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord. For the Postganglionic neuron the soma is usually on a ganglion near the target organ. Neurotransmitters released from the postganglionic synapse are acetylcholine or nitric oxide. The target organ oval points to a box which says "Rest and digest" response is activated. On the Sympathetic side, the image indicates that for the preganglionic neuron the soma is usuall in the spone. For the Postganglionic neuron the soma is in a sympathetic ganglion, located next to the spinal cord. The neurotransmitters relased from postganglionic synapse are norepinephrine. The target organ oval points to a box which says "fight or flight" response is activated. One box points to both parasympathetic and sympathetic parts of the autonomic nervous system and it says Neurotransmitter released from the preganglionic synapse is acetylcholine.
